Just a script and a Makefile which I use to sync/share images from days out taking pictures/concerts with my friends. Up here for reference. Uses [`sigal`](https://github.com/saimn/sigal) internally.

See the orchestrating in [`Makefile`](./Makefile) or [`manage`](./manage) for how it does its stuff.
